    "Q1.What is multiprocessing in python? Why is it useful?\\\n",
    "Multiprocessing in Python refers to the ability to run multiple processes in parallel, each with its own memory space and resources. \n",

    "\n",
    "multiprocessing involves running multiple processes, each with its own copy of the Python interpreter. This allows for true parallelism, as each process can \n",

    "Q2.What are the differences between multiprocessing and multithreading?\n",
    "\n",
    "CPU usage: In multiprocessing, each process runs on a separate CPU or core, enabling true parallelism. In multithreading, multiple threads run within the \n",
    "same process and share the CPU resources, which can lead to less efficient use of CPU time.\n",
    "\n",
    "Overhead: Creating and managing multiple processes involves more overhead than creating and managing multiple threads. This can make multiprocessing\n",
    "slower to start up than multithreading.\n",
    "\n",
    "Communication: Interprocess communication (IPC) in multiprocessing requires explicit communication mechanisms such as pipes, queues, or shared memory.\n",
    "In multithreading, communication between threads can occur more easily and efficiently using shared variables or message passing.\n",
    "\n",
    "Complexity: Multiprocessing is generally more complex to program than multithreading, due to the need to manage multiple processes and explicitly \n",
    "coordinate communication between them.\n",

    "Memory: In multiprocessing, each process has its own memory space, which is separate from the memory space of other processes. In multithreading, \n",
    "multiple threads share the same memory space within a single process."
