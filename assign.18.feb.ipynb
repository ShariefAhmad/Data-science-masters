    "RESTful web services are designed to be scalable, flexible, and easy to maintain.\n",

    "Shortcomings of SOAP include:\\\n",
    "Complexity: SOAP is a complex protocol and can be difficult to implement and use compared to simpler protocols like REST.\\\n",
    "Overhead: SOAP uses XML to format and transfer data, which can add overhead and increase network traffic compared to more lightweight protocols.\\\n",
    "Lack of support for web standards: SOAP does not always support web standards such as caching and browser back/forward buttons.\\\n",
    "Poor performance: SOAP can be slower than other protocols due to the additional overhead and complexity."
