    "Q5.State advantages and disadvantages of multithreading\\\n",
    "Advantages:\\\n",
    "Fast performance: Multithreading  improves the performance of a program by allowing multiple threads to execute concurrently. This can lead\n",
    "to faster execution times and better resource utilization. \\\n",
    "Better resource management: Multithreading allows a program to use system resources more efficiently by distributing tasks across multiple threads. \n",
    "This can help reduce the overall system load and improve the utilization of resources such as CPU and memory. \\\n",
    "Responsiveness: Multithreading can make a program more responsive by allowing it to perform multiple tasks at the same time. This can be particularly \n",
    "useful in applications that require real-time processing or user interaction.\\\n",
    "Modular design: Multithreading allows for a modular design of a program, where different parts of the program can be executed concurrently in separate \n",
    "threads. This can make the program more manageable and easier to maintain. \\\n",
    "\n",
    "Disadvantages: \\\n",
    "Increased memory usage: Multithreading can increase memory usage, as each thread requires its own stack and thread-specific data. This can be a concern in \n",
    "memory-constrained environments. \\\n",
    "Complexity: Multithreading can add complexity to a program, making it harder to design and debug. Managing shared resources and avoiding race conditions \n",
    "can be particularly challenging. \\\n",
    "Synchronization overhead: Multithreading can introduce synchronization overhead, which is the cost of coordinating access to shared resources among multiple\n",
    "threads. This can slow down the program and reduce its overall performance. \\\n",
    "Deadlocks and race conditions: Multithreading can introduce deadlocks and race conditions, which are difficult to debug and fix. Deadlocks occur when two\n",
    "or more threads are blocked waiting for each other to release a resource, while race conditions occur when multiple threads access a shared resource in an\n",
    "unpredictable order. \\\n"

    "Q6. Explain deadlocks and race conditions.\\\n",
    "Deadlocks and race conditions are two common issues that can arise in multithreaded programming. \\\n",
    "\n",
    "Deadlocks occur when two or more threads are blocked waiting for each other to release a resource. This can happen when two or more threads acquire \n",
    "locks on resources in a different order. For example, consider two threads that need to acquire two locks, A and B, to proceed with their execution. \n",
    "If thread 1 acquires lock A and thread 2 acquires lock B, but then thread 1 tries to acquire lock B while thread 2 tries to acquire lock A, both threads\n",
    "will be blocked waiting for the other to release the lock they need. This can lead to a situation where the program hangs indefinitely.\n",
    "\n",
    "Race conditions occur when multiple threads access a shared resource in an unpredictable order, leading to unexpected behavior. For example, consider\n",
    "two threads that increment a counter variable by one. If both threads read the value of the counter at the same time, increment it, and write the updated\n",
    "value back to memory, they may both end up writing the same incremented value, effectively losing one of the increments. This can happen because the order\n",
    "in which the threads access the counter is not guaranteed, leading to unpredictable results."
